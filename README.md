## Data

Data comes from Article 19's annual reports that include breakdowns of spending by regional purpose. This breakdown was not provided before 2011.

## Notes

In 2011, Article 19 provided more detailed regional breakdowns, separating spending into subregions like East Africa, West Africa, etc. For the sake of comparability, I collapsed these subregions into larger regions:

- East and South East Asia → Asia
- South Asia → Asia
- East Africa → Africa
- West Africa → Africa
- Central America → Latin America
- South America → Latin America
